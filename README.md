> Here is a collection of various schematics for the Nintendo Famicom and related hardware.<br>
> Schematics were pulled from various Japanese sites and dumped onto an Atari themed vintage electronics focused website, however were "lost" when said website went down sometime between late 2017 and early 2018.<br>
> Thankfully, though, they were all backed up onto the Wayback Machine & various other sites, and just took a bit of digging to collect.<br>

> I do not know who the original creators of these schematics are, unfortunately.<br>
